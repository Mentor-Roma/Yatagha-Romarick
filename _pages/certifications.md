   *Issuing Organization*: EC-Council  
   *Date Obtained*: July 2025  
   *Description*: The CEH accredited by EC-Council, is a globally recognized certification that validates expertise in offensive cybersecurity. It equips professionals with the knowlege and ability to think like a hacker (using the same tools and techniques) but ethically, to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in systems, networks and applications. The certification covers 20 modern attack vectors, including cloud security, IoT hacking, and malware analysis, aligning with real-world threats. By earning the CEH, I've demonstrated hands-on proficiency in the following skills:
   - Penetration Testing
   - Network Security & Vulnerability Assessment
   - Footprinting & Reconniassance
   - Social Engineering & Phishing Attacks
   - Cryptography & System Hacking
   - Cloud Security & IoT Hacking

2. **Professional Cloud Security Engineer (PCSE)**  
   *Issuing Organization*: Google  
   *Date Obtained*: June 2025  
   *Description*: The PCSE certification, offered by Google Cloud, validates expertise in designing, implementing, and managing secure infrastructure in the cloud. This certification demonstrates hands-on proficiency in cloud security best practices, including identity/access management, data protection, network security, and threat mitigation. As a PCSE, I have mastered the skills to configure secure workloads, enforce compliance (e.g., GDPR and HIPAA), and respond to incidents using Google Cloud's native security tools like Security Command Center, Cloud IAM, and VPC Service Controls.  
   *Key Skills Acquired*:
   - Identity & Access Management (IAM):
      - Configuring least-privilege access with Cloud IAM roles, service accounts, and organization policies.
      - Implementing zero-trust security with BeyondCorp principles.
   - Data Security & Encryption:
      - Managing encryption keys via Cloud KMS and Cloud HSM.
      - Securing data-at-rest/in-transit (e.g., default encryption, customer-managed keys).
   - Network Security:
      - Designing secure networks with VPC firewalls, Private Google Access, and Cloud Armor (DDoS protection).
      - Isolating workloads using VPC Service Controls and Shared VPC.
   - Threat Detection & Response:
      - Monitoring threats with Security Command Center (SCC) and Chronicle SIEM.
      - Automating incident response with Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, and Pub/Sub alerts.
   - Compliance & Governance:
      - Enforcing compliance frameworks (e.g., CIS benchmarks, NIST, ISO 27001).
      - Auditing configurations with Forseti Security (policy automation).
   - Secure Workload Deployment:
      - Hardening GKE (Kubernetes) clusters and VM instances.
      - Securing serverless environments (Cloud Functions, App Engine).

### Attestations
1. **Data Science Attestation** 
In February 2022, I successfully completed the MOOC titled Introduction to Data Science and its Challenges offered by CY Cergy Paris Université through the FUN MOOC platform. This course provided a foundational understanding of the core principles of data science, covering topics such as data collection, analysis, and interpretation, along with their practical applications in different domains.
The course was led by Matthieu Cisel, an experienced researcher and instructor, and gave me an opportunity to explore data science from both theoretical and practical perspectives. [View certificate]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/certificates/data-science-certificate.pdf)

2. **Pyhton Programming Attestation**
In May 2021, I successfully completed the MOOC titled Learn to Code with Python, offered by the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) through the FUN MOOC platform. This course introduced me to the fundamentals of Python programming, covering topics like data types, control structures, functions, and basic problem-solving techniques.
The course was taught by Sébastien Hoarau from Université de la Réunion, Thierry Massart from ULB, and Isabelle Poirier from Académie de Montpellier. Python language in one of the most widely used programming languages in data science and cybersecurity. [View certificate]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/certificates/FormationPython.pdf)
