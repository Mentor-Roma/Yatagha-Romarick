## Projects

### SMARTEST Project
**Role**: Researcher  
**Duration**: March 2024 - Present  
**Description**: 
The SMARTEST project aims to develop secure, smart systems for critical infrastructure. I focused on designing and implementing machine learning algorithms for real-time anomaly detection in industrial control systems (ICS). My work involved collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, and using technologies like OPC UA and predictive maintenance to ensure resilient operations. For more details on my contribution, read my [blog post on anomaly detection in smart systems](link-to-blog-post).

**Technologies**: Python, OPC UA, Jupyter, Kubernetes, Ansible


**Key Achievements**:
- Implemented a machine learning-based IDS for detecting network anomalies in smart factories.
- Presented findings at various international conferences.

### SYNAPSE EU Horizon Project
**Role**: Researcher  
**Duration**: September 2024 - Present  
**Description**: 
The SYNAPSE project focuses on the development of innovative cybersecurity solutions for critical infrastructure. I joined the project during its first plenary meeting in Rome, where we aligned goals and collaborated on designing a secure architecture for cyber-physical systems. For more details on my contribution, read my [blog post on anomaly detection in smart systems](link-to-blog-post).

**Key Achievements**:
- Developed a monitoring framework for secure network communications.
- Participated in an international plenary meeting with experts across Europe.

## Work Experience

### Cybersecurity Analyst, XYZ Corporation
**Role**: Cybersecurity Analyst  
**Duration**: June 2019 - August 2021  
**Description**:
