Hello! I'm Yatagha Romarick, a passionate cybersecurity researcher specializing in machine learning, anomaly detection, and critical infrastructure security. I am currently pursuing my PhD in cybersecurity, focusing on developing resilient solutions for cyber-physical systems and industrial environments.

Throughout my journey, I have been actively involved in a variety of research projects, including the use of machine learning to secure Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems, traffic generation for adversarial testing, and anomaly detection in resource-constrained environments. My research has been presented at several international conferences, such as CIKM, ICCP, and Kerntechnik, where I’ve shared insights into enhancing the security and resilience of smart systems.

I am also a strong advocate for practical cybersecurity, with experience in penetration testing of industrial devices like PLCs and remote access solutions such as Ewon Flexy. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, including Kubernetes, cloud security, and edge computing, to develop solutions that bridge the gap between research and real-world applications.

When I’m not immersed in research, I enjoy learning new skills, and collaborating on open-source projects that focus on cybersecurity solutions.. That's why I am always enrolled in a certification program.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to learn more about my research, projects, and professional journey. I’m always open to connecting and discussing new ideas, so don’t hesitate to reach out!
