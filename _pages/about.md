My work sits at the intersection of academic research and industrial security. I work as a Cybersecurity engineer at Framatome GmbH, where I focus on protecting critical infrastructure. This involves hands-on work, from hardening systems against threats and managing the security of Linux servers to running vulnerability scans, and even simulating controlled attacks on industrial control systems to better understand  their weaknesses.

Parallel to my work in the industry, I am completing my PhD, a journey that allows me to dive deep into the security challenges I encounter professionally. I believe in validating my skill through practical certifications, which has led me to obtain the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), the Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer, and the Certified Security Technician. I also regularly spend time on Hack The Box and VulnHub, taking capture-the-flag challenges to keep my skills sharp.

My research is an extension of this practical work. I have had the opportunity to publish several research papers, exploring topics like machine learning, adversarial attacks, and the security of industrial control systems. I have also supervised a good number of students for internship and master's thesis.
