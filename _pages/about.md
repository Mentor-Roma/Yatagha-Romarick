title: "Welcome to My Portfolio"
---

I am a cybersecurity professional with over five years of hands-on experience securing critical infrastructure systems, specializing in industrial control environments. My work spans offensive security and defensive innovation - from discovering zero-day vulnerabilities through advanced fuzz testing of nuclear I&C systems to designing AI-driven anomaly detection using Generative AI and LSTM for behavioral monitoring. As a published researcher in top IEEE and ACM conferences, I bridge theoretical research with practical implementation, having engineered solutions that withstand real-world threats in water treatment plants and industrial networks. 
My technical foundation is validated through industry certifications including the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Google Cloud Professional Security Engineer (PCSE), and Certified Cybersecurity Technician (C|CT). I maintain expertise in critical security standards like NIST SP 800-82 for industrial systems, IAEA Nuclear Security Series guidelines, and ISO/IEC 27001 frameworks. Beyond formal credentials, I continuously upgrade my skills through practical challenges, regularly participating in CTF competitions and platforms like HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and VulnHub, while contributing to OWASP and Nmap security initiatives.

As both practitioner and educator, I've designed secure network architectures featuring privileged access management systems and zero-trust VPN implementations, while also serving as a technical trainer for industrial control system security. My research in zero-day threat detection continues through my ongoing PhD work, where I'm developing next-generation monitoring systems that anticipate emerging attack vectors. This dual perspective - equally comfortable in operations and research - allows me to build resilient security postures that defend today's infrastructure while anticipating tomorrow's threats.

When not hardening critical systems or publishing research, you'll find me exploring the intersection of generative AI and defensive security or mentoring the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. I approach security not just as technical challenge, but as a safeguard for society's most essential systems - where every vulnerability patched and every anomaly detected translates to real-world safety and continuity.
