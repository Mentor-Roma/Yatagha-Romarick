The paper titled "Assessing the Complexity and Real-Time Performance of Anomaly Detection Algorithms in Resource-Constrained Environments" was presented at the ICCP 2024 conference. It explores various anomaly detection algorithms, evaluating their computational complexity and effectiveness in environments with limited resources, such as IoT devices or edge computing systems. The study provides insights into the suitability of different approaches for real-time applications, focusing on achieving a balance between detection accuracy and resource efficiency. This work is crucial for deploying robust security measures in constrained scenarios.
