I recently had the opportunity to present both a poster and a paper on anomaly detection at the Kerntechnik 2024 conference. This conference, held in Berlin, brought together experts from the nuclear technology sector, providing a unique platform to discuss security challenges and innovative solutions for critical infrastructure.

My presentation focused on anomaly detection techniques for enhancing cybersecurity in nuclear systems. Specifically, I showcased a hybrid model that leverages machine learning algorithms to detect irregularities in system behavior. This approach aims to proactively identify potential threats and minimize risks before they can impact critical operations.

The poster session was a fantastic opportunity to interact directly with attendees, answer questions, and receive feedback on our proposed approach. The discussions with fellow researchers and industry professionals sparked new ideas for improving the efficiency and reliability of anomaly detection systems in nuclear environments. Overall, the Kerntechnik 2024 conference was an invaluable experience, reinforcing the importance of robust cybersecurity in nuclear technology and critical infrastructure.
