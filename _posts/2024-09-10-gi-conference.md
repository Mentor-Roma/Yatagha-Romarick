I recently attended the Informatik 2024 conference, where I presented my latest paper on dynamic thresholding for anomaly detection in cyber physical systems (CPS). The conference was a wonderful platform to engage with researchers and industry leaders in the field of computer science and technology.

My paper focused on a novel approach for anomaly detection using dynamic thresholding to adaptively monitor the behavior of CPS. Unlike traditional fixed-threshold methods, this approach adjusts the threshold based on real-time data, providing a more responsive solution for identifying potential threats and anomalies. This dynamic approach is particularly important in CPS, where system behavior can be complex and variable, requiring more flexible security mechanisms.

The presentation led to insightful discussions on the potential for applying these techniques to other industrial environments, and I was thrilled to receive positive feedback from attendees. Presenting at Informatik 2024 was an excellent opportunity to showcase my research and collaborate with experts on advancing security in cyber physical systems.
