During my BSc in Combined Mathematics and Computer Science, I chose to address a common privacy concern for mobile phone usersâ€”ensuring that text messages remain private even after the device is unlocked. For my bachelor's thesis, I developed an Android application that provided an extra layer of security by encrypting text messages stored on the mobile phone.

The idea behind the application was simple but powerful: even if someone gains access to an unlocked phone, they would still need a decryption key to view the contents of the text messages. The application encrypts all messages using a user-defined key, and the messages could only be viewed by those who possess this key. This approach adds an extra level of control over privacy, ensuring that sensitive communications remain protected.

This project provided a practical implementation of both my mathematical and programming knowledge, allowing me to explore the field of cryptography in a real-world context. It was a rewarding experience to design and implement a system that helps maintain users' privacy in the era of increasingly accessible digital information.
