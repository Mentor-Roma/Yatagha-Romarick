The first day I joined the SYNAPSE EU Horizon project was marked by the excitement of meeting a diverse group of professionals and researchers from all over Europe. The first plenary meeting took place in Rome, Italy, where we gathered to align our goals and discuss the roadmap for this ambitious project.

The SYNAPSE project focuses on developing innovative cybersecurity solutions for critical infrastructure and smart systems. During the plenary meeting, we reviewed the project's objectives, shared initial research insights, and laid the groundwork for our collaborative efforts. It was inspiring to see the enthusiasm and commitment of everyone involved, and I left with a clear vision of the contributions I would make to advance the project's goals.

This experience not only allowed me to better understand the broader scope of the SYNAPSE initiative but also helped me establish strong working relationships with the international team. I am excited about the journey ahead and the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking research in securing critical infrastructure.
