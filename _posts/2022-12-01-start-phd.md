In December 2022, I embarked on an exciting new chapter by starting my PhD in Cybersecurity at the University of Siegen. My research focuses on developing machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for anomaly detection and securing critical infrastructures, such as industrial control systems, smart grids, and IoT environments.

The aim of my work is to propose innovative solutions for detecting and mitigating cyber threats in complex, distributed systems. By leveraging ML-based anomaly detection, I seek to identify potential threats proactively, helping to ensure the resilience and security of critical systems. My approach focuses on creating adaptable models that can detect subtle deviations in behavior, which may indicate emerging attacks, thus allowing for a rapid response.

Throughout this journey, Iâ€™ve been combining theory and practice, collaborating with researchers across multiple disciplines to advance cybersecurity solutions that can be applied in real-world scenarios. The work is both challenging and rewarding, pushing the boundaries of how we secure our most essential infrastructure in an increasingly interconnected world.
