I recently attended the KI 2023 conference in Berlin, where I presented my paper titled "Security Challenges and Best Practices for Resilient IIoT Networks: Network Segmentation." The conference was an incredible opportunity to connect with fellow researchers and industry professionals, discuss emerging challenges, and exchange ideas on cybersecurity for industrial systems.

In my presentation, I explored the vulnerabilities in smart factories, focusing on the use of network segmentation as a means to improve security. Specifically, the paper introduced an innovative approach that uses a clustering algorithm to implement an effective network segmentation policy for IIoT networks. This method categorizes network traffic based on various features such as IP addresses, protocols, and packet sizes, ultimately simplifying the segmentation process and enhancing security by reducing the complexity of managing interconnected devices.

The feedback I received from the attendees was insightful, sparking further discussions on the importance of dynamic security measures in industrial environments. Overall, the experience at KI 2023 not only expanded my professional network but also allowed me to showcase my work and receive valuable insights from experts in the field.
